Are you confused about what someone means when they say "test stub" or "mock object"? Do you sometimes feel that the person you are talking to is using a very different definition? Well, you are not alone!

The terminology around the various kinds of Test Doubles (page X) is confusing and inconsistent. Different authors use different terms to mean the same thing. And sometimes they mean different things by the same term! Ouch! (See the sidebar What's in a (Pattern) Name? (page X) for why I think names are important.)

Part of the reason for writing this book was to try to establish some consistency in the terminology to give people a set of names with clear definitions of what they mean. In this sidebar, I provide a list of the current sources and cross-reference the terminology they use with what I use in this book.

Role Descriptions
Here is a summary of what I mean by each of the major Test Double pattern names:

Pattern	Purpose	Has Behavior	Injects indirect inputs into SUT	Handles indirect outputs of SUT	Values provided by test(er)	Examples
Test Double	Generic name for family					
Dummy Object (page X)	Attribute or Method Parameter	no	no, never called	no, never called	no	Null, "Ignored String", new Object()
Test Stub (page X)	Verify indirect inputs of SUT	yes	yes	ignores them	inputs	
Test Spy (page X)	Verify indirect outputs of SUT	yes	optional	captures them for later verification	inputs (optional)	
Mock Object (page X)	Verify indirect outputs of SUT	yes	optional	verifies correctness against expectations	outputs & inputs (optional)	
Fake Object (page X)	Run (unrunnable) tests (faster)	yes	no	uses them	none	In-memory database emulator
Temporary Test Stub (see Test Stub)	Stand in for procedural code not yet written	yes	no	uses them	none	In-memory database emulator
Terminology Cross-Reference
I'm listing some sources of conflicting definitions just to make it clear what the mapping is to my pattern names:

Sources and Names Used in them
Pattern	Astels	Beck	Feathers	Fowler	jMock	UTWJ	OMG	Pragmatic	Recipes
Test Double								Double or stand-in	
Dummy Object	Stub				Dummy				Stub
Test Stub	Fake		Fake	Stub	Stub	Dummy		Mock	Fake
Test Spy						Dummy			Spy
Mock Object	Mock		Mock	Mock	Mock	Mock		Mock	Mock
Fake Object						Dummy			
Temporary Test Stub						Stub			
OMG's CORBA Stub							Stub		
Some specific examples from this table are:

Unit Testing With Java ([UTwJ]) uses the term "Dummy Object" to refer to what I am calling a "Fake Object".
Pragmatic Unit Testing [PUT] describes a "Stub" as an empty implementation of a method. This is a common interpretation in the procedural world but in the object world this is typically called a Null Object[PLOPD3].
Some of the early Mock Objects literature could be interpreted to equate a Stub with a Mock Object. This has since been clarified in [MRNO] and [MAS].
The CORBA standard (CORBA stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture and is defined by the Object Management Group)and other remote-procedure call specifications use the terms "stubs" and "skeletons" to refer to the automatically generated code for the near and far end implementation of a remote interface defined in IDL. (I've only included this here because it is another use of one of the terms we commonly use in the TDD and automated developer testing community.)

Feedback Requested
I need your feedback! Which names make sense to you? Which ones don't? What would you suggest instead?
